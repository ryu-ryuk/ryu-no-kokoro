# My First Blog (*´∀`*)
 
---  

## Welcome to my first ever blogging website

Hi there, I am **Alok**, an undergrad student at **IIT - Madras**, currently diving deep into learning about different **Cybersecurity** tools and explore **DevOps**. 
  

### Now you may ask~ "What do I need a blogging website for?"

- First of all, lets go through how am I blogging this right now. {link to the workflow section of this note}
- To make writing into a habit ~ 
- Significantly improving my typing speed. 
- To share my ideas and log it for my future self as a diary of memories. 
- The ease of just taking usual notes on Obsidian and deploying it to a static beautiful website sounded great to me :)
- ##### Because this project was just fun! 


### What's the *Workflow* for this Blogging Website? 

1. The website locally linked to the my [**Obsidian**](https://obsidian.md/) on my system (*Arch btw*) #dotifles
2. Every time i need to add some new data for my blog, I can simply open *Obsidian* and add a new file with my thoughts that I want to share. 
3. Once I am done doing that, I can run a script that syncs  my local obsidian folder to the **Gitlab** repository where I have my code for the blogging site.
4. The site is based on [**Hugo** - The world’s fastest framework for building websites.](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) and i am using the inbuilt theme #mention (will be redoing the entire structure on my own when I get some time).
5. Once the changes are pushed to *Gitlab* - I have setup Actions which will create a new branch for the Deploy.
